                                         Facial expression recognition using CNN

Introduction:

The goal of the project was to implement a classification algorithm that can automatically predict the categories of human expressions given human facial images. Facial expressions convey rich emotional information in human communication and interpersonal relations.Automatic facial expression recognition is a challenging problem and has many applications in multiple disciplines.
It has been proven that convolutional neural networks have advantages in object classification, especially for high-dimensional objects like faces.
