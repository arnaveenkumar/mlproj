**Introduction:**

The goal of the project was to implement a classification algorithm that can automatically predict the categories of human expressions given human facial images. Facial expressions convey rich emotional information in human communication and interpersonal relations.Automatic facial expression recognition is a challenging problem and has many applications in multiple disciplines.
It has been proven that convolutional neural networks have advantages in object classification, especially for high-dimensional objects like faces.

**Dataset:** (https://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/)

In this project, CNN models are trained on the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset to recognize 8 basic
emotions and neutral faces. We experimented different CNN architectures and methods such as dropout and batch normalization.
